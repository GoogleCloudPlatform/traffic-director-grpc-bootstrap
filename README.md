# GCP gRPC Bootstrap

This repository contains sources to generate a bootstrap file for the XDS
functionality in gRPC when using GCP and Traffic Director as your control plane.

The gRPC bootstrap format is described in [gRFC
A27](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/pull/170). More information about Traffic
Director is available on the [Google Cloud
website](https://cloud.google.com/traffic-director/).
